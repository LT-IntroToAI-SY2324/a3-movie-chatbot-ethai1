# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
Goes through each query and the corresponding function and attempts to find a match. If no match is found, it returns None. If a match is found but there's no answers, it returns no answers. Everything else is valid and the returns the answer in a list.

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
I added Your Name made in 2016 because I really liked that film and I will never forget it in my entire life.

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
I added "%" appeared in what movies? because it gives the user more choice in writing the query since they may not like the other one and this doesn't require any more code to be written aswell.

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
I would like to create a chatbot about games because I really like video games and it would function mostly the same as this one with changes in what it will return and other additions such as release dates for future games, ratings, genres, etc. Also, prints out the questions as there's not a lot available and its hard to remember the exacting wording of each question and perhaps I'll add more.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
The most difficult part for me was search_pa_list even though it was super short and simple because the other functions are relatively the same but for search_pa_list, I was struggling trying to figure out what to do and I also misused the match function and if I reviewd the match function more closely, I definitely would've gotten it.

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
Yes, however it breaks all of my code and I'm not sure why even though it resembles all the other asserts and I believe I correctly inserted the movie into the movie database.
